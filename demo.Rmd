# Introduction
Who am I? Where am I from? Could I code before Data School? What did my daily work pattern look like 
before Data School? Etc. The text you write here will be placed above the
two column format of the rest of the poster. Don't change the section title from "Introduction" 
otherwise it won't work.

# My Synthesis Project
This is the space to introduce your project in a few sentences. What were your goals, what was your 
data, how did you plan to approach it?

This poster template is built with modifications from the `posterdown` package. You will need this 
installed if you wish to build your own poster. For complete installation instructions visit the 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown), or to dive straight in, you can try
`remotes::install_github("brentthorne/posterdown")`.

In order to build this demo poster correctly, you will also need to have installed the `tidyverse`, 
`gapminder`, `gganimate`, and `kableExtra` packages.

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a poster including:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## My favourite tool (optional)

Is there any tool in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of the work on your synthesis project?

The second half of the poster will demonstrate the different visuals you might use to show off your 
data. To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

To make sure your content distributes across the two columns correctly, you may need to add some 
additional line breaks at this point to separate the text from the visuals:

<br/>

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

![](resources/img/posterdownlogo.png){width=180px}

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 3, fig.width=8}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


**Animations just to show off a digital poster**
```{r anim, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, out.width="100%"}
# cache=TRUE because the animations take a while to render
# so we don't want to render them unless we change the code in here

anim <- gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes("cubic-in-out")


animate(anim, nframes = 200, fps=20, detail = 2, start_pause = 20, end_pause=20, 
        width=1200, height=800, res = 200
)
```

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well

This section will also be shifted outside the two column format (to the bottom -- the focus of this
poster should be on your achievements in your project!). As with the Introduction, don't change the
name of this section otherwiseit will not be able to be moved.
