# Introduction 
I started Data School as an Administration Officer for Program 8.As of the first of July our program merged with Program 7. The new program is called Agri-food Systems, Landscapes and Global Change and I have a new role which will ensure best practice data archiving and management systems for our program. I will also be embedded into projects to provide project, data and analytic support. :)

# My Synthesis Project
This project will produce visualisations of statistical comparisons between\s\s

  * weather forecast data from the Bureau of Meteorology (ACCESS-S forecast model) ACCESS-S Hudson et al, ACCESS-S1: The new Bureau of Meteorology multi-week to seasonal prediction system, 2017,

Only one location will be used latitude=-35.99 & longitude=142.92, Birchip, Victoria https://dcdp.research.csiro.au/access-s?lat=-35.99&lon=142.92&format=csv&start=

AgScores will produce results to inform climate scientists of the efficacy of climate predictions, from the point of view of Agricultural productivity (wheat yield potential). This work enables climate scientists to debug their climate models when their predicted wheat yield potential does not match the predicted wheat yield potential of APSIM + SILO.

# My Digital Toolbox

I have used Python, Anaconda, Jupyter, xarray, requests, io, pandas, datetime, numpy, Matplotlib, from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D, Seaborn, scipy.stats, regex

## Favourite tool (optional)

I have a couple of favourite tools. 

![](resources/img/regex.jpg){width=100px style="float: left; margin: 2%"} allows you to pull out the exact subset of data that you need.

The second is matplotlib which allows you to make lovely visualisations from your data. ![](resources/img/matplotlib.png){width=200px style="float: left; margin: 2%"}

# My time went ...

by manipulating data to get it into shape. And then reshaping it to get it right again. I had help with the correct commands to pull the data out of the databases and then I was responsible for doing the manipulations.

and making plot after plot after plot. Most of these didn't really see the light of day but some are here on the poster and will help help to make the AgScores tool easier to use and interpret.

Embarrassingly, I spent a lot of time trying to work out paths to where my work was stored.![](resources/img/emoji.jpg){width=200px style="float: right; margin: 2%"} 


# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of the work on your synthesis project?

The second half of the poster will demonstrate the different visuals you might use to show off your 
data. To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If=====
To make sure your content distributes across the two columns correctly, you may need to add some 
additional line breaks at this point to separate the text from the visuals:

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

![](resources/img/posterdownlogo.png){width=180px}

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 3, fig.width=8}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


**Animations just to show off a digital poster**
```{r anim, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, out.width="100%"}
# cache=TRUE because the animations take a while to render
# so we don't want to render them unless we change the code in here

anim <- gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes("cubic-in-out")


animate(anim, nframes = 200, fps=20, detail = 2, start_pause = 20, end_pause=20, 
        width=1200, height=800, res = 200
)
```

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well

This section will also be shifted outside the two column format (to the bottom -- the focus of this
poster should be on your achievements in your project!). As with the Introduction, don't change the
name of this section otherwiseit will not be able to be moved.
